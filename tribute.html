            <p class="text-lg">Charles Babbage (1791â€“1871) was an English mathematician and inventor. He is credited with designing the first digital automatic computer, which contained all the essential concepts found in the ones we use today.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Born: December 26, 1791 - Passed: October 18, 1871</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Contributions to Computer Science</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mt-2">Charles Babbage studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he first had the idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables. In 1823, he obtained government support to design the Difference Engine, capable of storing data for later processing. He later conceptualized the Analytical Engine, the precursor of modern digital computers, incorporating features such as punched card instructions, a memory unit, and sequential control.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-2">In 1991, British scientists successfully built the Difference Engine No. 2 based on his specifications, proving his ideas were viable. Beyond computing, Babbage contributed to the modern postal system, actuarial tables, the speedometer, and the train cow-catcher.</p>
